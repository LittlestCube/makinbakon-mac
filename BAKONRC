# The Makin' Bakon configuration file.

# You have a choice of nine colors for bold, fore(ground) and back(ground).
# These are:
#
#      black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white and trans.
#
# Setting the trans (transparent) option throughout will leave your terminal
# settings unchanged, which suits some transparent terminals like Aterm and
# Eterm. However, if you choose this path then you may want to set the
# terminals BOLD to a different color. See your terminal man pages for
# instructions. 
#
# The keyboard option can be either American (us) or British (uk)
#
# The program defaults are as follows...
#
#   fore=trans
#   back=trans
#   bold=trans
#   keyboard=uk  
#
# but they will only be used if your definitions are incorrect. Command-line
# options override any options you set here, even incorrect ones, so you might
# find it quicker to muck about with those first...

fore=trans
back=trans
bold=trans
keyboard=uk  

# Enjoy Makin' Bakon!

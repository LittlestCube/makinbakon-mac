Makin' Bakon Typing Tutor * version 0.3.2
Copyright (C) Stephen Webster 2002 2003

--------------------------- release version 0.3.2 ----------------------------
1: Removed ios::in from ofstream declarations in pigsty.cpp, so Makin' Bakon
   now opens scores file properly during start-up. 
2: Updated copyright to include year 2003.
--------------------------- release version 0.3.1 ----------------------------
1: Minor code alterations so that it compiles with GNU GCC 3.2.
--------------------------- release version 0.3.0 ----------------------------
1: Accepts defaults from ~/.bakonrc file for keyboard type, foreground,
   background and bold colors.
2: Accpts command-line options which override rc file defaults.
3: Introduced a new fortune based lesson strictly from offensive archives.
4: Fortune based lessons can now only change lesson stats after lesson_length
   characters have been typed (rather than after every line).
5: Removed preferences utility for keyboard type as this is now set using
   rc file or command-line options.
6: Bonus point system awards one wpm every time target speed is passed.    
7: A lot of the code has been overhauled and the error handling has been
   greatly improved.
8: Default lessons have been divided into groups, effectively halving the
   size fo each lesson. This makes the lessons both shorter and more concise.
--------------------------- release version 0.2.2 ----------------------------
1. Makefile now checks for curses includes.
2. Minor changes to default lesson texts.
--------------------------- release version 0.2.1 ----------------------------
1. Added hand-rolled poetry, startrek and offensive fortune archives.
2. Greatly improved Makefile.
3. Paths to data and fortune archive files are now compile-time defined.
4. Fixed bug that re-paints the virtual keyboard in lesson screens after
   choosing '(R)epeat lesson' or '(N)ext lesson'.
--------------------------- release version 0.2.0 ----------------------------
1: Statistics engine now outputs a running total of the users typing speed
   and accuracy.
2: The lesson screen now includes a virtual keyboard for displaying finger
   placement (layouts reflect keyboard types).
3: [Anorak Alert!] Classes that were almost continuosly in scope, or those
   with a lot of static variables, have now become singletons, thus we no
   longer have to keep track of static initialisations.
4: Wpm score now only gets written to defaults file if it is greater than
   the previous session score.
5: [Anorak Alert!] Makefile now checks for fortune databases before compiling
6: The statistics engine deducts 1 wpm for any number of mistakes in a word,
   where a word is 5 characters.
7: [Anorak Alert!] Fixed bug that caused intermittent core dump in FreeBSD
   (The last element of the main menu wasn't set to NULL, ooops...)
--------------------------- release version 0.1.1 ----------------------------
1: Fixed bug in Makefile so that program compiles properly in FreeBSD.
2: [Anorak Alert!] Moved <time.h> header from stats.cpp to stats.h so that
   program compiles properly in FreeBSD.

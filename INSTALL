Makin' Bakon Typing Tutor * version 0.3.2
Copyright (C) Stephen Webster 2002 2003

------------------------------- FreeBSD Users --------------------------------

Makin' Bakon needs GNU Make, so you'll have to replace the following 'make'
commands with 'gmake'.

-------------------------- Installing Makin' Bakon ---------------------------

Just follow the instructions and all should go well. However, if make does
bail out with an error then see the checklist at the end of this file...

1: To install Makin' Bakon, untar the zip file like this:
   tar xvzf makinbakon<version>.tar.gz

2: cd into the makinbakon directory and type 'make'

3: Become root user and type 'make install'. (If you're installing on top
   of an older copy then type 'make uninstall' first.)

4: Become user again.

5: If you want to clean out the src directory of object and executable files
   then just type 'make clean'.

6: To summarise:

   tar xvzf makinbakon.tar.gz
   cd makinbakon
   make
   become root
   ('make uninstall' if you have previously installed Makin' Bakon)
   make install
   become user again
   make clean
   
7: Type 'make help' for a brief description of all the above commands

All docs are copied to /usr/doc/makinbakon

   The fortune archives are copied to /usr/local/makinbakon/archives
   The datafiles are copied to /usr/local/makinbakon
   The executable is copied to /usr/local/bin/bakon
   
If you want, copy the BAKONRC file to .bakonrc in your home directory. If
you don't want, one will be created for you on first start-up.
   
To use, read the section on command-line options in the README, then just
type 'bakon' at the command prompt, followed by any options.   

---------------------------- Error check List --------------------------------

Make exits with one of the following errors...

1. "You must install fortune before compiling Makin' Bakon!"

   Fortune is either not installed on your system or is not in your PATH.
   You'll find download suggestions in the README. If you do have fortune
   but for some reason it isn't in your PATH (do 'echo $PATH') then you can
   include it in your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc. For example, if fortune was
   found in /usr/local/games/fortune, then you could add the following line:
   
   PATH=$PATH":/usr/local/games"
   
2. "Please install the curses development package first!"
   
   The Makefile searches for the curses development files in '/usr/include',
   which is where g++ expects to find include files. If it doesn't find
   them it will ask you to install the curses development package.
   
3. " 'strfile' not found. Do 'make MY_PATH=/path/to/strfile' "

   Fortune uses the strfile command to create its .dat archive files and so
   does Makin' Bakon. (It comes as part of the fortune program.) Some Linux
   distributions don't always put 'strfile' in your PATH. Although the
   Makefile checks loads of different paths for 'strfile' it may still
   escape detection. Do 'whereis -b strfile' or 'locate strfile' and copy
   the executable path into the instruction like so...
    
   make MY_PATH=/usr/local/strange/bin/strfile

Other errors should be self explanatory. If not, or if you have problems with
any of the above, then don't hesitate to contact me:- moonunit@ukonline.co.uk

                           --- PROJECT STUFF ---
				
1: Sound as a command-line option.
2: Offer chioce between offensive and non-offensive fortune databases as a
   command-line option.
3: Scrolling help screen for the curses window, divided into sub-sections
   and navigable via both an index and the up/down keys, a` la info.

   sprites...)

                         --- CODE ENHANCEMENTS ---

1: Class for specifically handling string formatting - presently handled as
   required by individual classes: These are:- Display (format.cpp), Lesson
   (lessonDefault.cpp), Gettext and Fortune. Use c++ iterators in all string
   formatting functions, instead of 'c' style string indexing operator[] as
   is presently the case.
2: Class for handling file operations as fstream code was a real pain to
   trace during recent update to gcc 3.2.

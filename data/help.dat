Pig grudgingly welcomes you to the Makin' Bakon typing tutor. If you want
to save his bacon then you'll have to beat your target score, which isn't
that easy, so please read these simple destructions carefully.

1: Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the menu. Use the page-up and
page-down keys to take you to the beginning or end of the menu. Press the
return key when you've made your choice. The letters in brackets are keyboard
shortcuts. Press the letter that corresponds to the lesson you want. You can
use upper and lower case letters for all the keyboard shortcuts.

2: The first option in the menu is the default lesson. Each default lesson is
designed to introduce you to various parts of the keyboard. Pig recommends
that you follow the default lessons as you'll probably type faster that way. 

3: The top window of the lesson screen displays the actual lesson, you know,
the words you're supposed to type... Just type the letter under the cursor.

4: The middle window in the lesson screen displays your scores (words per
minute, accuracy and overall score for the session). To free Pig you will
need to do better than your target score, which is displayed with the lesson
title at the top of the screen. A bonus point is awarded if you beat your
target score and wpm points are deducted if you make mistakes, so the best
way to beat your target score is not to make too many mistakes...

5: If you finish a lesson early your score will be that of the last completed
lesson. (Remember that Pig has a vested interest in your score...)

6: You can turn the scores window off with CNTRL+S. It will remain off
throughout the session, mostly... Okay, you get to see how bad you're doing
at the end of each lesson, but otherwise it stays off. You turn it back on
again with CNTRL+S.

7: Lesson shortcut keys are displayed at the bottom of the screen, so don't
worry about remembering them. Don't forget that you can use both upper and
lower case letters for all keyboard shortcuts. 

8: The lower window in the lesson screen displays a virtual keyboard with
highlighted finger positions and a finger positioning text inside the
virtual spacebar. It will be a lot easier to save Pig in the long run if you
make good use of this window when you first start to type. You can turn off
the virtual keyboard with CNTRL+N. It will remain off throughout the session,
or until you turn it back on again with CNTRL+N.

9: The Fortune lessons (Humorous Pig, Poetic Pig, StarTrek Pig...) use
epigrams from the Fortune program. Bear in mind that they contain numbers
and symbols, so your score could be seriously depleted if you haven't first
completed the default lessons!

10: If you get to a lesson and you want to review the lesson instructions
then press CNTRL+I. In fact you can do this at any time during a lesson
as the timer is automatically paused. (So if your fingers get tired half way
through a line then just press CNTRL+I!) Press CNTRL+I again to turn this
window off, the timer will re-start as soon as you type the next letter.

11: When you finish a lesson you can go straight onto the next lesson by
pressing the 'N' key. Default lessons can be repeated by pressing the 'R'
key.

12: If the default lesson is too easy for you, or you want to revise some of
the key presses, then you can change the default lesson group by choosing
"Change Default" from the menu. Navigate as you did with the main menu,
using the up/down, page-up/page-down keys. Press CNTRL+E if you go there by
mistake or you were just curious.

13: In the unlikely event that you want to quit the program, you can go back
to the menu screen and choose "Quit The Pig!", or just press CTL-Q whenever
you like, though Pig will be more than a little upset if you haven't reached
your target. In fact he'll be a packet streaky!

That's all there is to it. Pig wishes you every success. Have Fun...

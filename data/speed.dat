In the olden days in England, you could be hung for stealing a sheep or
a loaf of bread.  However, if a sheep stole a loaf of bread and gave it
to you, you would only be tried for receiving, a crime punishable by
forty lashes with the cat or the dog, whichever was handy.  If you
stole a dog and were caught, you were punished with twelve rabbit
punches, although it was hard to find rabbits big enough or strong
enough to punch you.

Parrafin - Part One: The first Great Steward, Parrafin the Climber, was
employed in King Chloroplast's kitchen as second scullery boy when the
old King met a tragic death. He apparently fell backward by accident on
a dozen salad forks. Simultaneously the true heir, his son Carotene,
mysteriously fled the city, complaining of some sort of plot and a lot of
threatening notes left on his breakfast tray. At the time, this looked
suspicious what with his father's death, and Carotene was suspected of
foul play. Then the rest of the King's relatives began to drop dead one
after the other in an odd fashion...

Parrafin  - Part Two: Some were found strangled with dishrags and some
succumbed to food poisoning. A few were found drowned in the soup vats,
and one was attacked by assailants unknown and beaten to death with a pot
roast. At least three appear to have thrown themselves backward on salad
forks, perhaps in a noble gesture of grief over the King's untimely end.
Finally there was no one left in Minas Troney who was either eligible or
willing to wear the accursed crown, and the rule of Twodor was up for grabs.
The scullery slave Parrafin bravely accepted the Stewardship of Twodor until
that day when a lineal descendant of Carotene's returns to reclaim his
rightful throne, conquer Twodor's enemies, and revamp the postal system.

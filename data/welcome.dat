Your mission: save Pig from the clutches of the evil Factory Farmer, 
a pernicious entity with no name who is intent on Makin' Bakon, or Pork Pies,
or even Substandard Sausages!

You may ask what's in it for you, you mercenary, politically insensitive
skid-mark! Well, you learn to type to a professional standard while you're
saving Pig's bakon, now doesn't that make you feel good?

Before getting to any of the really smelly stuff, however, you've got to
do a test lesson, just so that we can make it as difficult as possible for
you. If you've never done any typing before then press CNTRL+I as soon as you
get to the test screen and all will be revealed. Press CNTRL-Q at any time
to quit the program. God Save the Pig!

WARNING: Some of the material contained within is really dirty, as dirty
as the soles of the factory farmers wet, smelly  boots. If you're easily
offened then use another typing tutor...
